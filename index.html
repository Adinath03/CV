        <h1> Adinath Dagadu Mahandule </h1>
        <p> Final year BE student at Ramrao Adik Institute majoring in <em><strong> Computer Science.</strong></em> <br>
          A highly organized and hard-working individual
          looking for a responsible position to gain
          practical experience. </p>
        <p> I've always been fascinated by technology since I was a child. Building and creating applications tap into my creative edge, and I enjoy solving the problems I encounter along the way.
          I have developed numerous projects during my engineering curriculum in domains like <strong><em>Android Development, Web Development, and Machine Learning,</em></strong> and recently I have worked on a research-based project for modifying
          the
          page ranking algorithms in it
          we studied different page ranking algorithms and modified the weighted page rank algorithm such that it considers time spent by a user on a particular website for calculating it's rank.
          My preferred programming language is <strong><em>C++</em></strong>. I have recently also done some project work in python. I like to think positively & work well w teams, and I'm always eager to learn new things. In my free time I enjoy
          going for
          a walk, or a hike in
          nature. I also love to read mystery and mythological books. </p>

  <h3> Projects </h3>
  <ul>
    <li> <strong>Daily Route Planner:</strong> Designed and developed an android application using Android Studio which can find an
      optimum route for traveling between multiple locations. The application is based on Google Maps API which lets
      you easily include maps on your websites or in your mobile apps. On entering the source and destination multiple
      routes will be formed using Dijkstra's algorithm application will determine which is the optimum route.
      <br><strong>Technologies Used: Android Studio, Google Cloud console.</strong>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Blood Bank Management System:</strong> Developed and designed a fully functional Web-based Blood Bank
      Management System that enables individuals who want to donate blood to interact with the needy. It also enables
      Hospitals to record and manage a database of blood donors who are willing to donate blood in case of emergency.
      Hospitals can also conduct Blood Donation drives using this system.
      <br><strong>Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, JavaScript.</strong>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Search Engine Optimization:</strong> Search engine optimization was a research-based project in which we studied
      different page ranking algorithms and then decided on modifying weighted PageRank. Since weighted page rank is
      based on the weightage of in-links and out-links of a particular web page, we have added one more constraint to it
      which is time. Normalized the time spend on the website and developed an equation for calculating time-based
      weighted page rank.
      <br><strong>Technologies Used: Python, Visual Studio Code.</strong>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Face Mask Detection:</strong> Trained machine learning model using python script, tensor flow, and CNN as deep
      learning architecture to develop an efficient network for recognizing individuals who wear facemasks and
      Developed a specialized CNN model to detect whether or not someone is wearing a mask. This model can instantly
      recognize the faces of the mask from any angle. The model is trained on a training dataset consisting of images of
      people wearing a mask and people who are not wearing a mask.
      <br><strong>Technologies Used: Jupyter Notebook, Python, Kaggle for dataset</strong>
